## MN Queer Party Archive
MN Queer Party Archive is a space for the MN queer community to archive their parties.  The goal is to allow users to create the archive by allowing them to upload posters from queer events with poster image, description and event date.This application is not a social media tool. It is meant to archive queer community through the weird and wonderful parties that we have. It is not a museum space, instead itâ€™s a community tool where users get to add and manage their own content. 

After mapping out my project I created the components. 
Then I set up the routes, sagas, and reducers. Focusing on the React component named Archive that renders a list of posters and provides options to add content or view individual posters. 

React component named ViewPoster that is using Redux for state management and React Router for navigation. This component appears to display information about a specific poster, including its images, description, date, and associated memories. Users can delete and edit individual memories, and there's a button to navigate back to the archive.

To DO 
fix addPoster button
reload all data from launch
check everything is working with heroku launch
clean up all templates and not used components
