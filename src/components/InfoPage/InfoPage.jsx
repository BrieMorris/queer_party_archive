The goal is to allow users to create the archive by allowing them to upload posters from queer events with poster image, description and event date.This application is not a social media tool. It is meant to archive queer community through the weird and wonderful parties that we have. It is not a museum space, instead itâ€™s a community tool where users get to add and manage their own content.
